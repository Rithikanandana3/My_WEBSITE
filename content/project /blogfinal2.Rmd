#This is my story 

Hailing from Asia, I am Rithika Satish. While Iâ€™m originally from Mumbai, India, I have spent the last four years in Singapore. Growing up I moved between several cities in India, 9 to be precise.In high school I took a keen interest in Mathematics and Social Studies and decided that I wanted to bring these two interests together to study Economics. I pursued Economics at Singapore Management University.While Economics will always be my passion, I have come to love finance too. I wish to create long-term impact on companies and industries by being engaged in advisory services related to Mergers and Acquisitions. My hobbies include tennis and fencing.Im also a foodie at heart and love trying new cuisines out. I recently tried African cuisine for the first time and loved it.
